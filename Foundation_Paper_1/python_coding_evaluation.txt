Q1.
1. The if loop requires a colon at the end of the line
2. The print function requires the format method to successfully print the 
    max number
3. The operator is the wrong way; it is checking if the num is smaller than
    the max_num
4. The return statement needs to be indented in line with the for loop
5. The list of numbers need to be within square brackets
6. The list of numbers and print() should be after two lines

Code:
def find_max(numbers):
    max_num = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num


numbers = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5]
print("Max num is: {}".format(find_max(numbers)))

Q2. This is a good attempt to find a solution to the given problem. To continue
    on your coding journey please make sure you check your syntax and that you are
    familiar with different Python objects, e.g lists, tuples, sets. Also, 
    be careful of your indentation and read the errors in your environment when
    coding.
