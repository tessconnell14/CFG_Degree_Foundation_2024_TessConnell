Q1. 
a. The subquery has an error in the syntax; it requires the keyword IN
b. The department = NULL needs to be changed to IS NULL

Code:
  WHERE
	department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id 
    FROM departments 
    WHERE department_name = 'Cardiology'
    OR department_id IS NULL
  )

Q2. Suggestions:
1. Join tables 'departments' and 'admissions' with the condition as department 
  name and date to make the query
2. Normalise data further so that each department name has an ID/primary key
3. Do not check for IS NULL because department_id is specified
